# ATDARS: Advanced Threat Detection and Response System

## Overview
ATDARS is a cutting-edge cybersecurity tool that detects and responds to network threats in real time. It combines machine learning, real-time packet analysis, and automated responses to ensure advanced protection against cyber attacks.

## Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis:** Monitors live network traffic for malicious activity.
- **Machine Learning Threat Detection:** Utilizes trained models to classify traffic as benign or malicious.
- **Automated Response:** Blocks malicious IPs and logs all suspicious activity.
- **Visual Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for real-time insights and metrics.
